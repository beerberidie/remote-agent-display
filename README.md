## 📋 Agent Architecture

The visualization represents a comprehensive AI agent system with:
- 1 Supervisor agent (Chief Orchestrator)
- 7 Core Development agents
- 11 Cross-Cutting Concern agents
- 5 Operations/Support agents

Each agent has specific responsibilities and connections to other agents, forming a neural network of specialized AI capabilities.
